# Google Summer of Code 2021

## Organization: CNCF with Layer5

As a participant of Google Summer of Code 2021, I worked with Layer5 to work on Meshery, introducing many features and rebasing few things on the server-side. I helped with adding/enhancing few commands in mesheryctl that helps in managing Filters, Patterns, Performance Results and Profiles, Environment checking etc. I also setup Unit and Integration Testing for mesheryctl by testing the cobra commands with recording their expected behavior and output in multiple scnearios, stored in golden files. I worked with consolidating multiple handlers on the server-side and also changing them in the whole project.

Here I have mentioned my goals and contributions!

### Goals: Meshery CLI
- Adding a new command to meshery's cli tool, i.e. mesheryctl for performance profiles and result management
- Introduction of Unit Testing and Integration testing for Cobra commands of cli tool, mesheryctl.
- Introducing health-checks for environemt checking of pre/post-deployment of meshery server
- Adding a new command to meshery's cli tool, i.e. mesheryctl for managing web-assembly filters

### Goals: Meshery Server
- Reworking of API endpoints
- Swagger spec and docs for Rest API
    - Spec definition
    - Docs published
    - Docs auto-published

### Goals: Others
- Documentation on writing Unit and Integration Tests and Contributing to Meshery Server Documentation
- Ci workflow for Swagger Documentaion and running Unit and Integration Tests with calculating Code-coverage with CodeCov
